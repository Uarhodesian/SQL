Module 4. Homework
1. Adjust a relationship between tables ORDERS and CUSTOMERS, where the ID field from CUSTOMERS tables should be a primary key, 
and the ID_CUSTOMER field from ORDERS table should be a foreign key field. After removing a customer, all his orders should also be removed.
USE odanylitc
ALTER TABLE ORDERS
ADD FOREIGN KEY (ID_CUSTOMER)
REFERENCES CUSTOMERS(ID)
ON DELETE CASCADE

2. Show the list of all products ordered along with first and last names of the customers.

FROM CUSTOMERS C, ORDERS O
WHERE C.ID = O.ID_CUSTOMER

SELECT FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, ADDRESS, PRODUCT_NAME
FROM CUSTOMERS JOIN ORDERS
ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.ID_CUSTOMER

4. Do the same task as in task 3, but filter only those customers who has no address in our database.
SELECT FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, ADDRESS, PRODUCT_NAME
FROM CUSTOMERS JOIN ORDERS
ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.ID_CUSTOMER AND CUSTOMERS.ADDRESS IS NULL

5. Show first and last names of all customers from CUSTOMERS table and appropriate product names from ORDERS table, also show customers without orders 
and orders without customers (if any).
SELECT FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, ADDRESS, PRODUCT_NAME
FROM CUSTOMERS FULL JOIN ORDERS
ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.ID_CUSTOMER

6. Show last names from CUSTOMERS table, who have not made any order (use JOIN).
SELECT FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, PRODUCT_NAME
FROM CUSTOMERS LEFT JOIN ORDERS
ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.ID_CUSTOMER
WHERE ORDERS.ID_CUSTOMER IS NULL

7. Show product names and amount of products from ORDERS table, for those products where customer is not set.
SELECT PRODUCT_NAME, AMOUNT
FROM ORDERS LEFT JOIN CUSTOMERS
ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.ID_CUSTOMER
WHERE ORDERS.ID_CUSTOMER IS NULL
